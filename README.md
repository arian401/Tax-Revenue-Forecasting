# Provincial Sales Tax Revenue Forecasting (2024â€“2029)

This project presents a comprehensive time-series analysis and forecast of a provinceâ€™s retail sales tax revenue for 2024â€“2029. Using historical data from 1987â€“2023 and forecasted economic indicators, the model projects future revenues to support budget planning and fiscal updates.
